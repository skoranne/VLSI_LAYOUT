              VLSI Layout Descriptor

  This file contains some example programs I have for
sequential logic synthesis, BLIF processing, and gate
level Verilog analysis.

  I am adding to this Magic VLSI layout reader which
was written in 1995-1996, and modified for modern C++
and boost::spatial_index which can be tried.
